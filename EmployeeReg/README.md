# User Guide
For my project, I created a registry for a company to keep track of their employees. I wanted to create an app that makes it easy for companies
to find employee information and lets employees update their details as well as delete their profiles altogether

## Main pages

The main components that my app is composed of are;

### `content.js = homepage`
### `manager.js`

This is where the managers can view the employees currently employed by the company

### `employee.js`

Here the employees have two options, to update already existing information or to add a new employee profile

### `newEmp.js`
### `update.js`

The components after that simply act as containers for certain content and so that the app stays well structured.

## Requirements

It was important to me that I got all the requirements finished for the deadline. There is Routing implemented which you can view in header.js which is where the navigation bar is encapsulated.

I have more than four components although not all are relevant (or have a lot of complicated code in them)

There is an option to read data in manager.js and can write, update and delete using employee.js

I did however have problems with both the writing and editting as the new employees would not appear on screen but the details would be shown in the console.

I encapsulated many groups of information using components and made sure to include the lifecycle hook which allows us to reload the data on the screen.

I do regret not having more time as I was not able to do much work on the design aspect due to unexpected errors in my code functionality. All in all, I hope that I have covered the mininumum requirements at least and have all the functionalities working and code well commented
